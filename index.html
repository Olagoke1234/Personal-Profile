          <p>
            My name is Olagoke Olorunkosebi, and I am excited to share my
            journey with AltSchool. I joined AltSchool because, AltSchool offers
            a personalized and student-centered learning experience tailored to
            individual strengths, interests, and learning styles.

          <h2>My goals</h2>
          <p>
            In my time at AltSchool, I plan to achieve AltSchool's emphasis on
            project-based learning which aligns perfectly with my goal to
            develop innovative thinking and problem-solving skills. I look
            forward to participating in hands-on projects that challenge me to
            think outside the box. I am passionate about working on projects
            that would solve day to day problems of people. I believe AltSchool
            is the perfect place for me to pursue my dreams.
